# Inspirational Quotes Project

This project provides a collection of 100 inspirational quotes that can be used in various applications, such as Java Swing, web apps, or command-line programs. The quotes can motivate and encourage users through their journey by displaying positive and inspiring messages.

## Features
- Contains 100 unique motivational and inspirational quotes.
- Can be easily integrated into projects that require quote generation.
- Each quote is stored in a single text file, making it easily accessible for any programming language.

## Project Structure
- **quotes.txt**: A file containing 100 quotes, each on a new line without numbering.
- **src/**: (Optional) Folder to store any source code or example programs to display quotes.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to use or contribute to the Inspirational Quotes Project.

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of file handling in programming languages (optional for integration).
- A text editor or IDE to view or edit the quotes file if needed.

### Steps to Use

1. **Download the Project**  
   Clone the repository or download the `quotes.txt` file.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inspirational-quotes.git
   ```

2. **Access the Quotes File**  
   Navigate to the project directory and open `quotes.txt`. Each quote is on a new line, making it easy to read programmatically.

   ```bash
   cd inspirational-quotes
   ```

3. **Integrate into Your Project**  
   - In **Java**, read `quotes.txt` line by line to display a random quote in a Swing GUI application.
   - In **Python**, use file handling to read a random quote and display it in the console or integrate it into a web app.
   - In **JavaScript**, fetch quotes from the file (or an API if deployed) and use them in your web applications.

4. **Run an Example Program (Optional)**  
   An example program that displays a random quote can be included in `src/`. Run it to see how quotes can be displayed dynamically.

### Example Usage (Python)

```python
import random

# Load quotes from the file
with open("quotes.txt", "r") as file:
    quotes = file.readlines()

# Display a random quote
print(random.choice(quotes).strip())
```
