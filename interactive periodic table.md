Interactive Periodic Table 🧪🔬

📋 Project Overview

The Interactive Periodic Table is a Java-based desktop application that provides a detailed and user-friendly view of the periodic table. Users can interact with elements to get comprehensive information about each one, search for elements based on atomic number, symbol, or name, and test their knowledge with educational quizzes.

This project is perfect for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning more about chemistry in an engaging way.
