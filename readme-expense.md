#### Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartExpenseTracker.git
   cd SmartExpenseTracker
   ```

2. **Set Up the MySQL Database**
   - Open your MySQL client and run `db/setup.sql` to set up the database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE expense_tracker;

     USE expense_tracker;

     CREATE TABLE users (
         user_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
         username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
         password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
     );

     CREATE TABLE expenses (
         expense_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
         user_id INT,
         category VARCHAR(50),
         amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
         date DATE,
         description TEXT,
         FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
     );

     CREATE TABLE budgets (
         budget_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
         user_id INT,
         category VARCHAR(50),
         limit_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
         start_date DATE,
         end_date DATE,
         FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id)
     );
     ```

3. **Configure Database Connection**  
   Update `DatabaseConnection.java` with your MySQL credentials:
   ```java
   private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/expense_tracker";
   private static final String USER = "your_username";
   private static final String PASSWORD = "your_password";
   ```

4. **Run the Application**  
   Use your IDE to compile and run the `MainApp.java` file. This launches the login screen, where users can sign up or log in.

#### Usage

- **Dashboard**: Once logged in, users are taken to the main dashboard with options to add new expenses, set budgets, and view insights.
- **Add Expenses**: Add a new expense by entering category, amount, and date. 
- **View Insights**: Access visual charts showing monthly or yearly spending, and receive budget recommendations based on patterns.
- **Set Budget**: Define monthly budgets for specific categories and receive alerts if spending exceeds the set amount.
- **Generate Reports**: Generate PDF reports for specific time periods (monthly or yearly) to view and analyze spending.

#### Additional Features

- **Visualization Libraries**: Use libraries like JFreeChart for interactive graphs and visualizations.
- **PDF Generation**: Generate PDF reports with libraries like Apache PDFBox or iText.

#### Possible Future Enhancements

- **Multi-Currency Support**: Allow users to track expenses in different currencies.
- **Cloud Integration**: Save data to a cloud database for access from multiple devices.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Add a mobile version of the app to sync with the desktop version.
